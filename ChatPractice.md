How do I make Github work?
GitHub is a powerful platform for managing code repositories and collaborating with others on software projects. 
To get started, you'll want to create a GitHub account if you haven't already. 
Once you're signed in, you can create a new repository to host your code, or you can fork and clone existing repositories to work on them.
